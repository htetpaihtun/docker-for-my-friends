Teaching docker to my friends. (:

Hello this is "INTRODUCTION TO DOCKER FOR MY FRIENDS". 

This is my take on docker after learning containerization technology for a year so I may not be very experienced and "all knowing" around docker but hey, here's my 10 cents for those people like me who wants to learn docker from absolute beginner perspective. :)

Also I will add some additional information about best practices, my own practices and things to aware while getting started (as I learn through) for using docker to its potential.
This course will cover all you need to know and all you might want to know about Docker.
Enjoy.. 

In this course, you will learn;
- Overview of Containerization technologies and the evolution of software virtaulization.
- Architecture and concepts of Docker.
- Installing docker.
- How to build, run and maintain images and containers.
- Running multi-containers with Docker-compose and Docker stack. 
- Hands-on examples and best practices.
